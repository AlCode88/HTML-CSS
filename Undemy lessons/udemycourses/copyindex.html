            Muhammad Ali, considered to be the greatest heavyweight boxer, died late Friday night in a Phoenix-area hospital at 74 years old.<br>
            Here is a list of some of his best quotes (in no particular order): 
        </p></h2>
        <p>
            <h3><strong>1. "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see. Now you see me, now you don't.<br> George thinks he will, but I know he won't.</strong></h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3><strong>2. "Don’t count the days; make the days count."</strong></h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                <strong>
                    3. “If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe it—then I can achieve it." <br> Jesse Jackson said this as early as 1983, according to the Associated Press, and Ali used it in his 2004 book.
                </strong>
            </h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>
                <strong>
                    4. "Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with the extra ounce of power it takes to win when the match is even."
                </strong>
            </h3>
